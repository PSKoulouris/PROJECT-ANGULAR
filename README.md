Shinrin-Yoku Plant Store is an online platform inspired by the Japanese wellness practice of forest bathingâ€”immersing oneself mindfully in nature to reduce stress and promote well-being. This store offers curated indoor plants designed to bring the calming effects of nature into your home.

The platform was created using Angular for a robust, scalable frontend and Tailwind CSS for modern, responsive styling that captures the serene aesthetic of nature.
